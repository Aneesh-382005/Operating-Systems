/*
 * Write a program using C/C++/Java to simulate the priority scheduling (pre-emptive as well as 
non-preemptive approach) and RR, CPU scheduling algorithms. The scenario is: user may 
input n processes with respective CPU burst time and arrival time (also take the priority number 
in case of priority scheduling). System will ask the user to select the type of algorithm from the 
list mentioned above. System should display the waiting time for each process, average waiting 
time for the whole system, and final execution sequence.
