/*Write a program in C/C++/Java to simulate the Bankerâ€™s algorithm for 
deadlock avoidance. Consider at least 3 processes in the system, with 4 
resource classes having at least one resource instance for each class. 
Assume the values for Available, Allocation, MAX, and request from 
a particular process from your side. Program must reflect two cases, 
where a safe sequence exists for one and safe sequence does not exist 
for another. */
